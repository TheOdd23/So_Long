# So_Long

Creation of first graphical project. The goal was to create a small 2D video-game in which you need to pick up collectibles so you can access the exit tile.

The map was created with a file given in argument. The map was made-up with different characters, such as 1 for walls, 0 for floor, C for collectibles, etc. It needed to respect a set of rules, such as no unknow character, map must be rectangular and close by walls, etc.

There was some bonus you could implement, I decided to make some ennemies that move at the same time than the player. If you touch one of them, it's game over.

I had a lot of fun creating the different sprites and the concept of the game.
